# Votewatch
(working title)

Keep track of what your representative is doing in the House of Commons and let them know what you think about how they vote on your behalf!

Votewatch will optionally notify you every time your MP casts a vote and inform you what was up for debate, when, and which way they voted. Each vote is presented for you to register your approval/disapproval, with the option to directly open an email popup to their official contact address if you feel particularly strongly about the issue at hand and their registered stance on it.

(put media here)

## How to use

- Android: download the Votewatch .apk [here](wherever we host it)
- iPhone: download the (how do iphones work?) [here](wherever we host it)

Alternatively, us anything with a web browser and visit the site at [the hosting service](wherever we deploy to)

Search for your MP by name or constituency, or alternatively use our postcode search if you've lost track somewhere in all the reshuffles.

## FAQ

### Why though?

Tom: Our brief was 'Tech for Good', and fetching pertinent information from a reliable source and showing it to people from the comfort of their pockets "didn't look like it would be too hard given that we've got less than two weeks" (sorry team!). Aside from the practicalities, I've been personally affonted for a long time at the ridiculous level of abstraction that political information is filtered through, both on the way to and from our MPs. This seemed like a way to bring some reality back into the process of representative democracy for all parties involved - in coding terms, 'tightening the loop' and 'getting visibility on' expected vs real behaviours of the country's government.
